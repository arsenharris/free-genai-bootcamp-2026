        Let's break this sentence down step by step and translate it naturally into Spanish.

        First, here is the vocabulary you will need:

        | English | Spanish |
        |----------|----------|
        | the children | los niños |
        | the kitchen | la cocina |
        | the milk | la leche |
        | are | están |
        | did you buy | compraste |

        Now we can build the sentence.

        For the first clause, we say:
        Los niños están en la cocina.

        For the second clause, we ask:
        ¿Compraste la leche?

        Full sentence:
        Los niños están en la cocina, ¿compraste la leche?

        Sentence structure:
        [Subject: los niños] [Verb: están] [Prepositional phrase: en la cocina], 
        [Verb-past: compraste] [Object: la leche]?

        Notice that "compraste" is the second person singular preterite form of "comprar".

        Cheatsheet:
        | Word | Spanish | Type |
        |------|----------|------|
        | children | niños | Noun |
        | kitchen | cocina | Noun |
        | milk | leche | Noun |
        | to be (location) | estar | Verb |
        | to buy | comprar | Verb |

        Sentence structure:
        [Subject] [Verb] [Location]  , [Verb-past] [Object] 

        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two clauses separated by a comma
        - The first clause expresses location
        - The second clause asks about a past action
        - Spanish does not use auxiliary verbs for past tense questions

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location prepositions
        - ask clues about past tense formation
        - ask clues about subject omission
        - ask clues about question formation
